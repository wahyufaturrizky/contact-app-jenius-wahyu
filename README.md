## Reflection

This was a project built during 3rd year of Engineering college as a personal project. The Project goal was to use `ReactJs` technology to create a react app to store a contact details in a `Realtime Database`.

One of the main challenge I ran into was Database and Storage, here I have used Firebase `RealeTime Databse` and `Storage`
